  /**
   * @remarks The WireGuard Reference at 5.4.7 explains the idea of Cookie, where if the
   * Server is overloaded and cannot accept new connections, it will return a cookie packet
   * as opposed to the second packet of the handshake. The idea is that the peer will wait the
   * timeout period, and when they request a handshake again, provide this cookie. Don't think
   * of this cookie like an internet cookie: It doesn't cache any part of the handshake such that
   * the peer can just sent the cookie as opposed to the first packet of the handshake. They still
   * need to do the work, including generating new ephemeral keys; to my understanding, the cookie
   * is little more than a priority queue. The Reference stipulates that (5.3): "When
   * the responder receives the message, if it is under load, it may choose whether or not to accept and process the
   * message based on whether or not there is a correct MAC that uses the cookie as the key. This mechanism ties
   * messages sent from an initiator to its IP address, giving proof of IP ownership, allowing for rate limiting using
   * classical IP rate limiting algorithms (token bucket, etcâsee section 7.4 for implementation details)"
   * You may notice the language "choose to accept based on a correct MAC based on the cookie." (mac2). This, to
   * me, reads that peers connecting without cookies are deprioritized to those that do have cookies.
   * @remarks Now, onto how the Cookie actually works: The random value cookie_random is hashed with the clients IP and Port.
   * This creates a random value, cycled every 2 minutes, that the server sends to clients. By setting the value with the
   * client's IP, it necessarily ties the cookie to a particular client, so it can't be reused by other peers. However, if we
   * send the cookie across the wire it would be possible to brute force the random value given that we know the IP of the
   * peer; so, we add additional measures. Firstly, we encrypt the message with the server's public key (Nothing too
   * special here), and use a randomized nonce (So a cookie cannot be reused), but then provide AAD as the mac1 of the
   * the original packet. In doing so, only the person who sent the original handshake packet is able to decrypt the cookie.

   * @param cookie: Whether we are sending a cookie.
   * @remarks This function completes the entire Handshake Process for a
   * WireGuard connection. The flow of logic is somewhat complicated:
   * Both initiator and responder enter this function, where the responder
   * immediately waits for the client to provide an InitPacket. The client
   * stepping into Handshake1, dutifully produces that Packet, adds
   * some information to the configuration, and gets the working values
   * of H and C. It then steps back to this function, where it sends the
   * packet across, and then waits. The responder then receives this packet,
   * and uses the populated InitPacket runs through Handshake1, reaching the
   * same state as the initiator. It then steps into Handshake2, completing
   * its part of the Handshake, producing Transport Keys that have been derived
   * from both Static and Ephemeral of both peers, and sends the ResponsePacket
   * across. The client then wakes up, and uses this ResponsePacket to run through
   * Handshake2, ending with the same Transport Keys, and a completed configuration.
   * @remarks An aside for the template: in C++, if you have a circular dependencies
   * and you don't want there to be one, you can hand wave it away with templates.
   * The queue is defined in network.h, and for a while this function lived in that
   * header, but it didn't make much sense: it'S a WireGuard handshake. So, what do we do?
   * We make the function a template, and then each instance of the Handshake called (Spoilers,
   * it's only called with Q = network::queue), is created by the compiler. So, we can stick
   * Handshake here, and don't even need to explicitly provide Q in the function calls because
   * C++ is smart enough to deduce it based on the function arguments.
